# PAD Example

For the sake of training the model, a game named "Flower Hunter" was developed, inspired by old-school top-down 2D games like Legend of Zelda. It was designed to be easily modifiable, fast-running, compatible with Python machine learning libraries, and ultimately entertaining enough to motivate users to play it. The game and all of the required code and data for training and using the predictive PAD model can be found in the following GitHub repository:

In this repository, one can find anotated traces and all the code required to train a PAD predictive model and use it to predict each of the three dimensions of the PAD model for new traces, be them generated by real users or by AI agents. Instructions on how to do so can be found in the repository.
