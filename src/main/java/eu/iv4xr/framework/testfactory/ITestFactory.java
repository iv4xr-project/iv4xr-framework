/**
 * A TestFactory is an interface for any program that can produces 'tests'. Use
 * this interface to wrap around a testing tool or algorithm that produces a
 * test case or a test suite. This interface defines how such an algorithm can
 * be interfaced with {@link eu.iv4xr.framework.mainConcepts.TestAgent}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To interface a test algorithm to test-agents we see the algorithm as a 'test
 * factory'. As such, the algorithm produces either test-cases (if it aims to
 * produce a whole test suite) or just test-steps (if it aims to just produce a
 * test-case). To be understood by the test agents, these test-cases or
 * test-steps have to be formulated as goal-structures (instances of
 * {@link nl.uu.cs.aplib.mainConcepts.GoalStructure}), which can then be given
 * to a test-agent to be executed.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The algorithm can be thought to produce a sequence of goal-structures; the
 * method {@link #nextGoal()} can be invoked to obtain the next goal-structure,
 * and then given to the method {@link #execute(GoalStructure)} to be executed.
 * The latter gives the structure to the designated agent, and the agent will
 * execute the tactics embedded in the goal-structure to accomplish the goals in
 * the goal-structure.
 * 
 * <p>
 * We should note that while goals formulate states we desire to achieve,
 * something should be invoked to actually 'solve' them. In iv4xr solvers are
 * expressed in terms of so-called tactics
 * {@link nl.uu.cs.aplib.mainConcepts.Tactic}. It is the responsibility of the
 * test algorithm to provide suitable tactics for the goals it sends to the
 * test-agent. The test-agent itself mainly provides a runtime system for
 * managing goals and executing the tactics (this involves determining which
 * primitive-tactics can execute and choosing which one to execute, and for
 * solving which goal).
