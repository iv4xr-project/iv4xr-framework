HOW TO GET the EXECUTABLE OF the game LAB-RECRUITS
===================================================

We do  not provide the executable. You need to build it from the source. Get the source from:

   https://github.com/iv4xr-project/labrecruits

You can build an executable using the UNITY game development platform. You need a specific version of UNITY --see the above github site.

Once you build it, put it under this directory:

gym
 |--Windows
 |   |--bin
 |       |-- put here your windows executable: "LabRecruits.exe" and other stuffs
 |==Mac
 |   |--bin
 |       |-- put here your mac executable: "LabRecruits.app"
 |--Linut
     |--bin
         |-- put here your linux executable: "LabRecruits" and other stuffs
